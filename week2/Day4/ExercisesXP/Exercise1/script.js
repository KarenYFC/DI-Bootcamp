//Create 2 variables, x and y. Each of them should have a different numeric value.
let x = 2;
let y = 2;

//Write an if/else statement that checks which number is bigger.
Example :
if (x > y) {
    console.log(`x is the biggest number!`);
}else if (x == y){
    console.log(`x is equal to y!`);
}else{
    console.log(`y is the biggest number!`);
}


//You should display:
//x is the biggest number
